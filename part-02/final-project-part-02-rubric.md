# FINAL PROJECT, PART 2: RUBRIC

---

## Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark sections with an `X` or `n/a` if a score does not apply. Grades and indiviual feedback are only necessary for **"Required"** sections; bonus objectives are primarily intended for student enrichment.

#### RUBRIC
Score  | Expectations
--- | ---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Goes above and beyond expectations, incredible!_

#### REQUIRED
1. Find a way to deploy your application 
   - What is the most basic way you can deploy the app? 
   - How can this deployment evolve over time?
   - Does it need a backend database? How would that work?
   - Explain the process of deploying your app.
2. Submit a rough draft of a few individual physical designs for specific components using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
   - What is the pipeline going to look like? What are the steps? Make a diagram.
   - Which pieces of infrastructure can utilize IaC? Call them out one by one.
   - How can this app be containerized? How would it be part of the overall pipeline?
   - What could a monitoring & alerting system look like? Draw it out. Research best practices and common configurations.

#### BONUS

1. Start documenting your deployment process and add it to a `README.md` file in your project. Explain how a newcomer to the project would get up and running quickly.
2. Document what has and has not worked so far in your team's efforts.
3. Begin implementing a basic CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments (coming later in Part 03).
