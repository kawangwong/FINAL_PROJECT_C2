# Part 2: Deploy the App & Start Iterating

---

## Overview

Based on the feedback you received from your lightning talk, choose **one** of your topic areas to move forward. For Part 2, you'll need to think about how you are going to deploy your app.

Use your newfound skills to kickstart your project by deploying the app in one of the ways we learned in class. At this stage, it could be using a basic deployment method â€“ just focus on getting it out there for the world to see.

Create a shared repo for the team. Ensure all members have access to push changes to the repo. How does a deployment work? What does the flow look like? What tools are involved? Finally, deploy the app. It doesn't have to be fancy yet... that will come later.

**Goal**: Deploy the app and be able to demo it. Draft up a more detailed physical design of individual components.

## Requirements

1. Find a way to deploy your application 
   - What is the most basic way you can deploy the app? 
   - How can this deployment evolve over time?
   - Does it need a backend database? How would that work?
   - Explain the process of deploying your app.
2. Submit a rough draft of a few individual physical designs for specific components using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
   - What is the pipeline going to look like? What are the steps? Make a diagram.
   - Which pieces of infrastructure can utilize IaC? Call them out one by one.
   - How can this app be containerized? How would it be part of the overall pipeline?
   - What could a monitoring & alerting system look like? Draw it out. Research best practices and common configurations.

#### Bonus

1. Start documenting your deployment process and add it to a `README.md` file in your project. Explain how a newcomer to the project would get up and running quickly.
2. Document what has and has not worked so far in your team's efforts.
3. Begin implementing a basic CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments (coming later in Part 03).

## Deliverable Format & Submission

- Demo of the deployed application and how to interact with it
- PDF or PNG files with physical design for a few specific components (Pipeline, Containerization, IaC, monitoring & alerting)

---

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Review your initial proposal topic and feedback, and revise accordingly. 
- Spend time with your application and verify that it can help you accomplish the goals you set out to pursue. 
- If not, document how you intend to either change those goals. 
- Alternatively, go find some additional application and/or switch to something else if it is not working out as you expected.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

[Attached here is a complete rubric for this project.](./final-project-part-02-rubric.md)

Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

Score  | Expectations
--- | ---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Goes above and beyond expectations, incredible!_
