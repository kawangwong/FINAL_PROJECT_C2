# Part 1: Agree on a Project & Plan it Out

---

## Overview

In the field of DevOps, good projects are **practical**. This project will be a culmination of all of your efforts throughout Kura and combine many of the DevOps techonologies you have learned throughout the last few months.

This deliverable will provide you with guidance to help you select an awesome topic and begin to build a polished final project with your team. 

**Goal**: Host a lightning talk presentation describing *at least two* project proposals, including an application, associated technologies, a rough systems design, plan for splitting up future work and any initial findings.

---

## Requirements
1. Prepare a short slide deck and host a 3-5 minute lightning talk on **at least two** potential proposals for your DevOps final project. For each proposal, define **all** required areas:

2. Proposal 1
   - Application framework & use case
   - Rough systems design 
   - Technology choices
   - How team will split up work
   - Initial findings
   
3. Proposal 2
   - Application framework & use case
   - Rough systems design 
   - Technology choices
   - How team will split up work
   - Initial findings

#### BONUS
4. Beyond the two required topics, what other potential topics might you explore? (e.g. 3 or more)
5. Create a shared GitHub repo for your team to collaborate.
6. Deploy the application (coming next in Part 02).
 
 ***Remember, if you can't find an application as a basis for your project, then you can't move forward.***
